Description: This code is for serving static pages on localhost:5000 to help with web-development  
        
        Useful if a site uses xHttpRequests as just loading the file in a browser will often mean xHttpRequests do not work.  
        
        ### How to use
        Needs python3.7 or newer due to the change in annotations
        
        Run `python3.7 main.py [path to folder to serve]`  
        The path should either be local from where main.py is or an absolute path  
        
        `data/fileTypes.json` may need to be appended for special file types
